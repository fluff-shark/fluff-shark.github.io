description: "What do humans and recommenders have in common? We are Explorers and Exploiters."
synopsis: "Effective recommender systems make suggestions with a careful balance between how much they explore and exploit their options. Effective humans do the same with their hobbies and careers."

In broad terms, a recommender system:

1. Has a set of options to suggest
2. Ranks those options according to some criteria
3. Returns those options in ranked order

But this process is not exclusive to recommenders. Humans make decisions
in a similar way.

For example, when choosing a career:

1. We have a set of jobs available to us.
2. We evaluate those jobs based on our preferences and their market value.
3. Choose the jobs maximize our `value(enjoyment, salary)` function.

The same can be applied to our leisure time, replacing "jobs" with
"hobbies" and "salary" with "prices."

So how can we use what we've gained by developing recommenders
to help us make better decicions in our own lives?

### Exploring and Exploiting

One of the fundamental tradeoffs in recommender system design is the
balance between _exploring_ and _exploiting_ user preferences.

A recommender system **explores** user preferences by recommending things that
it's _unsure_ if they'll select. It **exploits** that knowledge by recommending
options the user is _most likely_ to select.

Neither extreme is ideal, and effective recommenders find a pleasing balance
between the two. For example, a recommender of books which is
_too exploitative_ might only suggest books by an author the user has
already read. But a recommender which is _too exploratory_ would suggest
such random books that the user would hardly call them "recommendations" at all.
Ultimately, users grow bored with recommenders that do too much exploring or
exploiting.

### Explorers and Exploiters

Just like the recommenders, we are all explorers and exploiters.
We have a life to fill, and all the possible jobs and hobbies in the
world to fill it.

**Too much exploration** and we won't:

- See our skills improve over time.
- Gain a deeper understanding of how our activities relate to the larger world.
- Benefit from the efficiency gains of specialization in our careers.

**Too much exploitation** and we won't:

- Learn principles from other fields which can inform the methods we use for our primary one.
- Be able to adapt when new technologies or changing labor needs threaten our specialization.
- Have fallback hobbies if we experience diminishing returns on our exploited ones.

Ultimately, a happy balance between exploration and exploitation is required for us to thrive.
