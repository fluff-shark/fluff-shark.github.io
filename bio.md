I'm **Dave Bemiller**, a full stack Staff Engineer working remotely from the mountains of
central Pennsylvania. After graduating in 2011 from Carnegie Mellon with a Physics degree, I've been working ever since as a software engineer in [education](https://www.ixl.com),
[finance](https://www.creditkarma.com), [advertising](https://www.xandr.com), and
[healthcare](https://carbonhealth.com).

My academic interests are [law](https://popehat.substack.com/),
[finance](https://www.amazon.com/Adaptive-Markets-Financial-Evolution-Thought/dp/0691135142),
[psychology](https://www.amazon.com/Behave-Biology-Humans-Best-Worst/dp/009957506X),
[design](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ui-ux-design), and
of course [software engineering](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RMSHYGG). My other hobbies are
hiking, snowboarding, and video games, depending on the weather and time of year.

My wife and I live with three photogenic fluffs:
