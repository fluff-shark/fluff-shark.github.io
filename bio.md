Hi. I'm **Dave Bemiller**, a full stack Staff Engineer in the mountains of central Pennsylvania.
After graduating from Carnegie Mellon in 2011, I considered three plans for adulthood:

1. Become a software engineer
2. Move to Asia and tutor English
3. Be homeless

Thankfully, option 1 was a great success. I've since worked as an engineer in
[education](https://www.ixl.com), [finance](https://www.creditkarma.com),
[advertising](https://www.xandr.com), and [healthcare](https://carbonhealth.com).

My other primary academic interests are law and finance. My hobbies are hiking,
snowboarding, and video games. My wife and I share our house with three photogenic cats.
